``TITLE``

AUTOMATIC WATER STORAGE AND MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

``DESCRIPTION``

IN SOME RURAL AREAS, DUE TO SCARCITY OF WATER, PEOPLE RECEIVE WATER ONLY TWICE A WEEK DUE TO WHICH THEY FACE PROBLEMS LIKE PAYING ATTENTION
ALL TIME WHICH IN RESULT THERE IS WASTE OF TIME AND IF THEY LAG IN PAYING ATTENTION THEY EITHER LOOSE THE WATER OR WASTE THE WATER, SO WE INTRODUE AN AUTOMATIC WATER STORAGE
AND MANAGEMENT SYSTEM USING PLC RSLOGICX WHICH INCLUDE SENSORS AND CONTROL VALVES. FURTHER, IT IS NOT ONLY USE IN HUSEHOLD WORKS BUT IT FINDS APPLICATION IN INDUSTRIAL PROCESSES 
DUE TO PRESENCE OF SCADA SYSTEM.

``TECHNOLOGY USED``

AUTOMATION USING PLC AND SCADA

``PROBLEMS FACED`` 
1) FIRSTLY, WE WERE MAKING SCADA INTERFACE IN ONE LAPTOP AND PLC LOGIC IN ANOTHER LAPTOP. SO, WHEN BOTH WERE READY, WE CAN'T ABLE TO TRANSFER FILES AND NOT ABLE TO COMMUNICATE.
SO WE BUILT SCADA INTERFACE IN THE SAME LAPTOP IN WHICH PLC LOGIC WAS BUILT.

2) SECONDLY, WE WERE FACING LOGICAL ISSUE IN TURNING MOTOR OFF WHEN ALL TANKS WERE FULLY FILLED AND ALSO WHEN SUB-TANKS (TANK-2 AND TANK-3) WERE HALF-FILLED AND WATER NEEDS TO BE SUPPLIED
FROM MAIN TANK AND AFTER THAT FILLING OF SUB-TANKS, THE MOTOR WAS NOT ABLE TO TURN OFF. (PROBLEM TOOK 3 HOURS TO SOLVE)

3) THIRDLY, WE FACED PROBLEM WHILE COMMUNICATING RSLOGIX AND SCADA SOFTWARE. ALSO IN SETTING TIME INTERVALS.

``INSPIRATION``

ALWAYS WANTED TO DO SOMETHING INNOVATIVE WHICH HELPS IN REDUCING HUMAN EFFORT 

``ADVANTAGES``
1) FULLY AUTOMATIC
2) SAVE WATER AND TIME
3) REDUCE HUMAN EFFORT
4) HIGHLY EFFICIENT
5) VERY RELIABLE IN COST

``DISADVANTAGE``
1) DUE TO FULLY AUTOMATIC, NEEDS ELECTRICITY TO WORK 
2) IN AUTOMATIC MODE, TANK WILL FILL IN SEQUENTIAL ORDER ONLY.
